Computer Shop Management System

The Computer Shop Management system is a system in which the user has to enter the model number of a particular product's total number of items. 
From these two fields, the system will generate a bill of the requested amount for that particular product. 
Apart from this, it will also keep track of all the items which are available in the shop.
